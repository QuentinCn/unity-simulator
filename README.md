## Overview

Welcome to the Unity Racing Line Simulator! This project simulates a racing environment where an AI trains to navigate racing lines. It consists of two main scenes:

1. **AI Training Scene**: The AI collects camera positions while running the simulation.
2. **Image Generation Scene**: Generates images based on AI-collected positions and creates associated CSV matrices that represent racing lines for further AI training.

## Features

- **AI Training**: Collects data through camera position tracking.
- **Image Generation**: Creates images and CSV matrices for autonomous racing.
- **Dataset Creation**: Generates datasets for training a separate AI to detect and create racing lines.
